# The Myth


### All myths are true and have happend
All myths about me are true, unless they are unflattering, then they are false.

## Myth One: I am a Genious (I invented that spelling.)

This is true; my IQ is likely 1000. Perhaps it is even 1001. Dalmatians! I'm always making connections like that. To me it's child's play.

As further proof of my intelligence observe this list of numbers I thought of off the top of my head:

- 12
- 134
- 6785
- 36
- 74.1
- 360,000,000
- 8007
   1. 8007.3 
   2. 8007.1001010203

## Myth two: I have class

This is true, as a man, I am very classy.

Remember: Boys have **swag**, Men have *class*.
